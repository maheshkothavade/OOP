# Object Oriented Programming concepts(OOPs)

## Four main pillars of OOP
* 1.Inheritance : A mechanism where a new class (child) derives properties and behavior from an existing class (parent)
* 2.Polymorphism : The ability of different classes to provide a unique implementation of methods that share the same name
* 3.Encapsulation : Wrapping data and methods that operate on that data into a single unit (class), and restricting direct access to some of the object's components
* 4.Abstraction : Showing only essential features and hiding the unnecessary details from the user
